# modelGraph

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of modelGraph is to provide a ggplot modelling numeric datasets.

## Installation

You can install the released version of modelGraph from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("georgewangyu/modelGraph")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(modelGraph)
plot_modelgraph(mtcars, cyl, mpg, model_type = "lm")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

This is what I did to create my R package:

###Steps that I took to create an R package and commit as git repository:
1. Loading devtools in the console (this must be done every time the console restarts), using library(devtools).
2. Ran create_package(“~/RStudio STAT 545/modelGraph”)
3. Ran use_git() to create git repository
4. In RStudio, went to Tools > Project Options … > Git/SVN. Under “Version control system”, select “Git” and confirmed yes.
5. Ran git init in console.
6. Committed the project.

### Linking to Github Repository:
1. Ran use_github() and confirmed selections

### Creating an R package with functions:
1. Turned my function from assignment 1-B into an R package.
2. use_r(“modelGraph”) and modified file by adding the function.
3. Tried the function by testing on the console.
4. Tested function by using load_all().
5. Clicked on check to ensure that the package was still intact.

### Editing Description file:
1. Added license via console: use_mit_license(“George Wang”).

### Running Roxygen skeleton:
1. Used “Code > Insert roxygen skeleton” and then added appropriate names, parameters, export, then ran document().
2. Ran install().

### Creating tests:
1. Ran use_testthat() and then manually added my tests for the function.
2. Manually changed the functions to include dplyr::, ggplot2::, gap minder:: for all associated functions and datasets for dependencies
3. Indicated dependency using use_package(“gapminder”), use_package(“dplyr”), use_package(“ggplot2”)

### Adding and editing readme file:
1. Add a package README with use_readme_rmd()
2. Edited manually to included further information.
3. Added line on installation: other people can install the package with devtools::install_github("your_username/package_name")

###Creating a vignette:
4. Made a vignette using use_vignette().

### Checked all functions and tests are still working before knitting readme file with build_readme().
