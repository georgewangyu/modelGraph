Description: This function allows you to create a model graph. The graph takes in an x and y arguments from the provided tibble column variables and creates a graph based on the model chosen (such as lm, glm, etc). You can also decide whether to remove N/A values from geom_point, as well as choose the color and size of axis titles. The function must have numeric x and y arguments and will stop if given other data types.
